# Algorand Wallet Arbitrary Data Signing API

> This ARC is inspired by [ARC-1](./arc-0001.md).

## Abstract

ARC-1 defines a standard for signing Algorand transactions that are represented as structured objects. This proposal extends the signing to generic byte arrays.

 [ARC-60](./arc-0060.md) defines an API for wallets to sign structured arbitrary data that are not Algorand transactions.

## Motivation

Signing data is a common and critical operation. Users may need to sign data for multiple reasons (e.g. delegate signatures, DIDs, signing documents, authentication).

Algorand wallets need a standard approach to byte signing to unlock self-custodial services and protect users from malicious and attack-prone signing workflows.

This ARC provides a standard API for bytes signing. The API encodes byte arrays into well structired JSON schemas together with additional metadata. It requires wallets to validate the signing inputs, notify users about what they are signing and warn them in case of dangerous signing requests.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> Comments like this are non-normative

### Overview

> This section is non-normative

Signatures of bytes are processed with the `signData(data, metadata, signer)` function.

`data` is a string representing the structured data being signed. It is the representation of a JSON Schema, provided with the `metadata`.

`metadata` is a `StdSignMetadata` object that describes the signature scope and the type of data being signed, including the encoding and the JSON schema.

`signer` is a byte array representing the public key to use for the signing operation.

### Interfaces

> Interfaces are defined in TypeScript. All the objects that are defined are valid JSON objects.

ARC-60 uses interchangeably the terms "throw an error" and "reject a promise with an error".

#### **Interface `SignDataFunction`**

A wallet function `signData` that signs arbitrary data is defined by the interface:

```tsx
export type SignDataFunction = {
    data: StdData,
    metadata: StdSignMetadata,
    signer: Ed25519Pk,
}
    => Promise<(SignedDataStr | null)>;
```

- `data` is a `StdData` object representing the structured data being signed (defined below).
- `metadata` is a `StdSignMetadata` objects (defined below) that provide additional information on the data being signed, such as the `data` encoding and the JSON schema.
- `signer` is a `Ed25519Pk` object (defined below) that represents the signer public key.

The `signData` function returns a `SignedDataStr` object or, in case of error, rejects the promise with an error object `SignDataError`.

#### Interface `StdData`

The `StdData` object is a string that comply with the `metadata` JSON schema. It **MUST** be the byte representation of a canonicalized JSON object, following the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785">RFC 8785</a>.

```tsx
export type StdData = string;
```

The `StdData` must be validated with respect the JSON schema provided with `metadata` (defined below).

#### Interface `Ed25519Pk`

An `Ed25519Pk` object is a 32-byte public key, point of the ed25519 elliptic curve. The key **MUST NOT** be transformed into an Algorand address.

```tsx
export type Ed25519Pk = Uint8Array;
```

> The wallet **MAY** want to operate with standard Algorand address directly. The transformation from a generic key to an Algorand address is left to the implementation. See <a href="https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/#transformation-public-key-to-algorand-address">Public Key to Algorand Address</a> section of the developer portal.

#### Interface `SignedDataStr`

`SignedDataStr` is the produced 64-byte array, ed25519 digital signature, of the `StdData` object.

```tsx
export type SignedDataStr = Uint8Array;
```

#### Enum `ScopeType`

The `ScopeType` enumerates constant strings with the scope of a signing action.

This ARC introduces two scopes for signing arbitrary bytes.

| ScopeType | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ARBITRARY | Signature of an array of arbitrary bytes. This is the most generic scope. |
| LSIG | Signature of an Algorand program for delegation. |
| ... | ... |

Any extension of this ARC **SHOULD** adopt the `ScopeType` above, or introduce a new scope.

#### Interface `StdSignMetadata`

A `StdSignMetadata` object specifies metadata of a `StdSignData` that is being signed.

```tsx
export interface StdSignMetadata {
    /**
    * The scope value of the signing data request.
    */
    scope: ScopeType;

    /**
    * Canonical representation of the JSON schema for the signing data.
    */
    schema: string;

    /**
    * Optional message explaining the reason for the signature.
    */
    message?: string;

    /**
    * Optional encoding used to represent the signing data.
    */
    encoding?: string;
}
```

If the `encoding` is not specified, the `StdData` object should be UTF-8 encoded following the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785">RFC 8785</a>.

##### Signing Data JSON Schema

The JSON schema for the structured signing data. The `StdData` **MUST** be an object of this schema.

> The signing data JSON schema is inspired by the schema proposed with <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712: Typed structured data hashing and signing proposal</a>.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "ARC60Domain": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The ARC-60 domain separator"
    },
    "bytes": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "integer",
        "minimum": 0,
        "maximum": 255,
        "maxItems": "<FIXED_LENGTH>"
      },
      "description": "The byte array to be signed."
    }
  },
  "required": ["ARC60Domain", "bytes"],
  "additionalProperties": true
}
```

- The `ARC60Domain` object indicates the domain separator to be used for signing. It **SHOULD** be set to `"arc60"` for arbitrary bytes. Algorand transaction domain separators `TX` and `TG` **MUST** be forbidden.
- The `bytes` object is the byte array of data being signed. It cannot be a valid Algorand transaction therefore **MUST NOT** be prepended with a known domain separator `TX` or `TG`.
- `additionalProperties` can be used to encode more complex arbitrary data.

> Algorand domain separators can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs/blob/master/dev/crypto.md#domain-separation">Algorand specs</a> and in the <a href="https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/blob/master/protocol/hash.go#L21">Go type HashID</a>.

For example, a valid object with the additional property `extra` is:

```json
{
  "ARC60Domain" : "arc60",
  "bytes" : "[99, 50, 97, 57, 51, 99, ..., 57, 49, 53]",
  "extraProperty": [
    {"extraField1" : "xxxx"},
    {"extraField2" : "yyyy"}
  ]
}
```

#### Error interface `SignDataError`

The `SignDataError` object extends the `SignTxnsError` defined in [ARC-1](./arc-0001.md).

```ts
export interface SignDataError extends Error {
  code: number;
  data?: any;
  failingSignData: (StdData | null);
}
```

`SignDataError` uses the same error codes of `SignTxnsError` as well as the following codes:

| Status Code | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4600 | Invalid scope | The scope of the signing action is not recognized by the wallet |
| 4601 | Invalid schema | The schema does not comply with ARC-60 requirements |
| 4602 | Invalid encoding | The canonical JSON cannot be decoded with the given encoding |

### Semantic Requirements

The call `signData(data, metadata, signer)` **MUST** either return the signed data `ret` or reject the call throwing an error `err`.

> Following [ARC-1](./arc-0001.md) terminology, in this ARC the term **Rejecting** means throwing an error with `err.code=4300`.

Upon calling `signData(data, metadata, signer)`:

- the `data`, `metadata`, and `signer` **MUST NOT** be `null`, otherwise the wallet **MUST** reject the call.
- if the encoding `metadata.encoding` is present, it **MUST** be used to decode the data `data`.
- the decoded `data` **MUST** be validated with respect to the JSON schema `metadata.schema`. If the validation fails, the call **MUST** be rejected with a `4300` error.
- the wallet **MUST** ask users for signing confirmation. It **MUST** display the `metadata.message` if present, and the structured `data` being signed
  - if the user approves, then `data.bytes` **MUST** be signed with `signer` and `ret` **MUST** be set to the corresponding `SignedDataStr`.
  - if the user rejects, the call **MUST** fail with error code `4001`.

Note that if `data.bytes` cannot be signed for any reason, the wallet **MUST** throw an error, such that

- `err.message` **SHOULD** indicate the reason of the error (e.g. specify that `data` is not a valid JSON object according to `metadata.schema`)
- `err.failingSignData` **SHOULD** return the `StdData` object that caused the error, otherwise `null`.

#### Semantic of `data`

- it **MUST** be a valid `StdData` object, otherwise the wallet **MUST** reject.
- the encoding **MUST** be equal to the value specified with `metadata.encoding` if any, otherwise it **MUST** be UTF-8.
- if `data` cannot be decoded into a canonicalized JSON object, the wallet **MUST** throw a `4602` error.
- if the decoded `data` does not comply with the JSON schema in `metadata`, the wallet **MUST** reject.
- the `ARC60Domain` filed must be validated against forbidden values:
  - the wallet **MUST** reject if `ARC60Domain="TX"`.
  - the wallet **MUST** reject if `ARC60Domain="TG"`.
  - the wallet **MUST** reject if `metadata.scope=ARBITRARY` and `ARC60Domain` field is not set to `"arc60"`.
- the `bytes` must be a valid byte array:
  - the wallet **MUST** reject if `bytes` is prepended with a forbidden domain separator `TX` or `TG`.

#### Semantic of `StdSignMetadata`

- `scope`:
  - it **MUST** be a valid `ScopeType` string, otherwise the wallet **MUST** throw a `4600` error.

- `schema`:
  - it **MUST** be a canonical JSON schema with the properties `ARC60Domain` and `bytes`, otherwise the wallet **MUST** throw a `4601` error.
  - the wallet **MAY** accept JSON schema with additional parameters. In that case, the wallet **MUST** verify that the `data` object contains all the parameters.

- `message`:
  - If specified, the message **SHOULD** be displayed to the user in plain text. The wallet **SHOULD** display the message `metadata.message` for any `arbData.data` being signed.

- `encoding`:
  - if specified, it **MUST** be used to encode the `data`.
  - the wallet **MUST** throw a `4602` error if the decoding fails with the given encoding value.

#### Semantic of `signer`

- it **MUST** be a valid `Ed25519Pk` object, otherwise the wallet **MUST** reject.
- the wallet **MUST** reject is `signer` is unknown.

#### General Validation

Every input of the `signData(data, metadata, signer)` must be validated.

The validation:

- **SHALL NOT** rely on TypeScript typing as this can be bypassed. Types **MUST** be manually verified.
- **SHALL NOT** assume that the provided `data` complies with the respective `metadata.schema`. The schema **MUST** be manually verified and all the required parameters **MUST** be checked.
- **SHALL NOT** assume that signatures are computed with the Algorand SDK `signBytes` function. There is no indirect validation on the passed `arbData` and `metadata` objects on that function. In general, the validation **SHALL NOT** rely on underlying SDKs to validate the inputs of an ARC-60 signing operation.

#### Display warnings

The wallet **MUST** display a warning message when the signing request (`ScopeType`) is related to a known Algorand action like `LSIG`, i.e. signing a logic signature for delegation.

The wallet **MUST** display a warning when a JSON schema with `additionalParameters` is provided, and warn the user about any additional property being signed.

## Rationale

This API was designed to enable a secure and structured signing of arbitrary data with Algorand wallets. The API:

- Only uses types supported by standard JSON schema
- Is generic to _pure_ ed25519 key pairs and do not require keys manipulation
- Is easy to extend with custom JSON schema to support future signing use cases (e.g. authentication)
- Is secure by design preventing malicious applications to trick users signing malicious messages or in worst cases approve malicious transactions.

This API was not designed to sign Algorand transactions or group of transactions (see ARC-1 instead).

## Backwards Compatibility

This ARC is not backward compatible with [ARC-47](./arc-0047.md) Logic Signature Template.

ARC-47 introduces the method `algo_templatedLsig` that takes a `LogicSignatureDescription` object and returns the signature of a logic signature program for delegation.

Al alternative using the ARC-60 `signData()` is given below, where:

- `data` **MUST** specify:
  - the `LogicSignatureDescription` object as detailed in ARC-47
  - the `values` of the templated variables and the `hash` of the expected program
  - the `ARC60Domain` must be set to the domain separator `"Program"`, as specified in the <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs/blob/master/dev/crypto.md#domain-separation">Algorand specs</a>.
- `metadata` **MUST** specify:
  - an extended ARC-60 compatible JSON schema
  - `ScopeType` set to `LSIG`.

The extended schema can be found in the `../assets/arc-0060` folder at the file [lsig-schema.json](../assets/arc-0060/lsig-schema.json).

### Semantics for signing a Logic Signature

- if the `metadata.scope` is set to `LSIG`:
  - the `ARC60Domain` value of `data` **MUST** be equal to the byte array corresponding to the prefix `"Program"` concatenated with the compiled logic signature, otherwise the wallet **MUST** reject.
  - the wallet **MUST** follow the ARC-47 specification: compile the program from the received template and check the integrity.
  - the `data.bytes` value **MUST** be equal to the compiled program prepended with the `"Program"` domain separator, otherwise the wallet **MUST** fail. If `bytes` if valid the wallet **MUST** sign with `signer` and return the result with `ret` as the corresponding `SignedDataStr`.

The implementation **MAY** use the Algorand SDK to generate a <a href="https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk/blob/a4eccfbeaac94f09d161aee45958f8b27923546c/src/logicsig.ts#L61">`LogicSig`</a> object `lsig` and sign it with the `lsig.signProgram` utility. In any case, the `data.bytes` **SHOULD** be validated by the wallet according to the expected format `(bytes("Program") + bytes(<compiledProgram>))`.

## Test Cases

N/A

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is available in the `../assets/arc-0060` folder.

- [simple-schema.json](../assets/arc-0060/simple-schema.json) provides a simple ARC-60 JSON schema
- [wallet.ts](../assets/arc-0060/wallet.ts) contains a simple TypeScript script showing how wallets can implement the `SignDataFunction` interface

## Security Considerations

Users signing bytes can be tricked to sign malicious messages being exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Users must be aware of what they are signing and for what purpose. The wallet **MUST** always show the message being signed along with the scope of the signing action and the message (if any). The requested signer **MUST** be displayed as well.

> For example:"You are about to sign the bytes `ARC60 is awesome` with scope `ARBITRARY` and message `Sign arbitrary bytes` with the key `1Cz6hgjfllYajnodkJ2hCi+GiYF6ndMHMstH9tJOqlg=`".
