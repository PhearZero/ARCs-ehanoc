# ARC-60 Arbitrary Data Signing

## Abstract

This ARC proposes a standard for arbitrary data signing. It is designed to be a simple and flexible standard that can be used in a wide variety of applications.

## Motivation

Signing data is a common and critical operation. Users may need to sign data for multiple reasons (e.g. delegate signatures, DIDs, signing documents, authentication).

Algorand wallets need a standard approach to byte signing to unlock self-custodial services and protect users from malicious and attack-prone signing workflows.

This ARC provides a standard API for bytes signing. The API encodes byte arrays to be signed into well-structured JSON schemas together with additional metadata. It requires wallets to validate the signing inputs, notify users about what they are signing and warn them in case of dangerous signing requests.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### Overview

ARC-60 defines a function `signData(signingData, metadata)` for signing data.

`signingData` is a `StdSigData` object composed of the signing `data` that instantiates a known JSON Schema and the `signer`'s public key.


### Signing Flow

When connected to a specific `domain` (i.e app or other identifier), the wallet will receive a request to sign some `data` along side some `authenticatedData`, which will look like some random bytes. With this information, the wallet should follow the following steps:

1. Hash the `data` field with `sha256`.
2. Knowing to what `domain` we are connected to, hash such value with `sha256` and compare it with the first 32 bytes of `authenticatedData`.
    2.1. If the hashes do not match, the wallet **MUST** return an error.
3. Append the `authenticatedData` to the resulting hash of the `data` field.
4. Sign the result

#### Summarized

```plaintext
EdDSA(SHA256(data) + authenticatedData)
```

### `Scopes`

Supported scopes are:

- `AUTH` (1): This scope is used for authentication purposes. It is used to sign data that will be used to authenticate the user. This scope is used to sign data that will be used to authenticate the user. The `data` field **MUST** be a JSON object with the following fields:
    - `type`:  the type of operation (e.g., "SIWA", “webauthn.create”, “webauthn.get”, etc)
    - `origin`: The origin / domain of the request or the URL of the relying party (RP) that initiated the authentication.
    - `challenge`: 32 bytes of entropy.

#### `StdSigData`

Must be a JSON object with the following properties:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data` | `string` | string representing the content to be signed for the specific `Scope`. This can be an encoded JSON object or any other data. It **MUST** be presented to the user in a human-readable format. |
| `signer` | `bytes` | public key of the signer. This can the public related to an Algorand address or any other Ed25519 public key. |
| `domain` | `string` | This is the domain requesting the signature. It can be a URL, a DID, or any other identifier. It **MUST** be presented to the user to inform them about the context of the signature. |
| `requestId` | `string` | It is used to identify the request. It **MUST** be unique for each request. |
| `authenticatedData` | `bytes` | It **MUST** include, at least, the `sha256` hash of the `domain` requesting a signture. The wallet **MUST** do an integrity check on the first 32 bytes of `authenticatedData` to match the hash. It **COULD** also include signature counters, network flags or any other unique data to prevent replay attacks or to trick user to sign unrelated data to the scope. The wallet **SHOULD** validate every field in `authenticatedData` before signing. Each `Scope` **MUST** specify if `authenticatedData` should be appended to the hash of the `data` before signing. |
| `hdPath` | `string` | This field is **optional**. It is required if the wallet supports BIP39 / BIP32 / BIP44. This field **MUST** be a BIP44 path in order to derive the private key to sign the `data`. The wallet **MUST** validate the path before signing. |

#### `metadata`

Must be a JSON object with the following properties:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scope` | `integer` | Defines the purpose of the signature. It **MUST** be one of the following values: `1` (AUTH) | 
| `encoding` | `string` | Defines the encoding of the `data` field. `base64` is the recommended encoding. |

#### `Errors`

These are the possible errors that the wallet **MUST** handle:

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ERROR_INVALID_SCOPE` | The `scope` is not valid. |
| `ERROR_FAILED_DECODING` | The `data` field could not be decoded. |
| `ERROR_INVALID_SIGNER` | Unable to find in the wallet the public key related to the signer. |
| `ERROR_MISSING_DOMAIN` | The `domain` field is missing. |
| `ERROR_MISSING_DOMAIN` | The `authenticatedData` field is missing. |
| `ERROR_BAD_JSON` | The `data` field is not a valid JSON object. |
| `ERROR_FAILED_DOMAIN_AUTH` | The `authenticatedData` field does not match the hash of the `domain`. |
| `ERROR_FAILED_HD_PATH` | The `hdPath` field is not a valid BIP44 path. |

## Security Considerations

 Wallets are free to make their own UX choices, but they **SHOULD** to show the user the purpose (i.e. `scope`) of the signature, the domain that is requesting the signature, and the data that is being signed. This is to prevent users from signing data that they do not understand.
